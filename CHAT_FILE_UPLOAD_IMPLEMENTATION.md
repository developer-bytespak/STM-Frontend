# Chat File Upload Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of file upload functionality in the chat system. Previously, file uploads were not working - only text messages were being sent.

## Problem Identified
The chat system had the UI for file selection but **did not actually upload files**. It just created local blob URLs that only worked in the sender's browser and were never sent to other users.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added File Upload API Endpoint (`chat.ts`)
- **New method**: `uploadChatFiles(files: File[])`
- Uploads files to `/chat/upload-files` endpoint
- Returns URLs of uploaded files that can be shared via messages

### 2. Updated Message Sending (`ChatContext.tsx`)
The `sendMessage` function now:
- **Uploads files first** to the backend server
- Shows an "Uploading..." indicator while uploading
- Receives file URLs from the server
- **Sends file URLs via Socket.IO** as document messages
- Handles upload errors gracefully with user feedback

### 3. Added Upload Method to API Client (`client.ts`)
- **New method**: `upload<T>(endpoint: string, formData: FormData)`
- Properly handles `FormData` for file uploads
- Includes authentication token
- Handles token refresh on 401 errors

### 4. Updated Message Display (`ChatContext.tsx`)
Both `handleIncomingMessage` and `loadMessageHistory` now:
- Detect file messages (type: 'document' or 'image')
- Parse file URLs from message content
- Extract filename from URL
- Create proper file objects for display

## Frontend Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/api/chat.ts`**
   - Added `uploadChatFiles()` method

2. **`src/api/client.ts`**
   - Added `upload()` method for FormData uploads

3. **`src/contexts/ChatContext.tsx`**
   - Made `sendMessage()` async
   - Implemented file upload workflow with loading states
   - Updated `handleIncomingMessage()` to parse file messages
   - Updated `loadMessageHistory()` to parse file messages
   - Added `extractFileName()` helper function

## Backend Implementation ✅

The backend has been fully implemented with the following:

### 1. File Upload Endpoint (IMPLEMENTED)
```
POST /chat/upload-files
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Request Body:
- files: File[] (up to 10 files)

Response:
{
  "urls": [
    "data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLj...",
    "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo..."
  ]
}
```

**Backend Implementation Details:**
✅ Accepts multipart/form-data with up to 10 files
✅ Stores files as base64 data URLs (for MVP)
✅ Returns data URLs that can be sent as messages
✅ Validates file types (PDF, images, docs, text files)
✅ Validates file sizes (max 10MB per file)
✅ Authenticates users via JWT token

**Files Modified:**
- `chat.controller.ts` - Added `uploadChatFiles` endpoint
- `chat.service.ts` - Implemented file upload logic with validation

### 2. Socket.IO Message Handling ✅
The backend already properly handles:
✅ Messages with `message_type: 'document'` are stored correctly
✅ The `message` field contains the file URL (data URL or external URL)
✅ File URLs are returned when loading chat history

### 3. File Storage Implementation
**Current Implementation (MVP):**
- Files are stored as base64 data URLs
- Embedded directly in messages
- No external storage needed
- Works immediately without additional setup

**Production Considerations (Future Enhancement):**
- **Storage**: Migrate to cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob)
- **Size limits**: Already implemented (10MB per file)
- **Security**: File type validation already in place
- **Access control**: Files are only accessible to chat participants (via auth)
- **Cleanup**: Consider implementing file expiration/cleanup policies
- **CDN**: Use CDN for faster file delivery

## How It Works

### Sending a File
1. User selects file(s) using the attachment button
2. User clicks send
3. Frontend shows "Uploading..." indicator
4. Files are uploaded to `/chat/upload-files`
5. Backend stores files and returns URLs
6. Frontend sends each file URL as a message via Socket.IO with type 'document'
7. Backend broadcasts the message to all chat participants
8. Recipients receive the message and can view/download the file

### Receiving a File
1. Socket.IO receives `new_message` event with `message_type: 'document'`
2. Frontend extracts the file URL from the `message` field
3. Creates a file object with name, URL, and type
4. Displays file with View and Download buttons
5. Clicking View opens file in new tab
6. Clicking Download triggers browser download

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test uploading a single PDF file
- [ ] Test uploading multiple files at once
- [ ] Test uploading images (jpg, png)
- [ ] Test uploading documents (pdf, docx)
- [ ] Test receiving files from other users
- [ ] Test viewing files (opens in new tab)
- [ ] Test downloading files
- [ ] Test error handling (network error, file too large, etc.)
- [ ] Test chat history loads files correctly
- [ ] Test file uploads work for both customers and providers

## Error Handling

The implementation includes:
- ✅ Network error handling with user alerts
- ✅ Loading indicators during upload
- ✅ Graceful cleanup on upload failure
- ✅ Connection status checking before sending

## Implementation Status

✅ **Frontend Implementation**: Complete
✅ **Backend Implementation**: Complete
✅ **File Validation**: Complete (frontend and backend)
✅ **Error Handling**: Complete
✅ **Socket.IO Integration**: Complete

## Future Enhancements

1. **Progress Indicators**: Add upload progress bars for large files
2. **Image Preview**: Add image thumbnails in chat for better UX
3. **File Metadata**: Store and display additional metadata (upload date, uploader, etc.)
4. **Cloud Storage**: Migrate from base64 to S3/cloud storage for better performance
5. **File Compression**: Compress images before upload
6. **Drag & Drop**: Add drag-and-drop file upload support

## Notes

- File uploads are sent as individual messages (one message per file)
- The system supports any file type, but you should add restrictions on the backend
- Files are displayed with View and Download buttons in the chat UI
- The UI already supports displaying files - it was just the upload that wasn't working
