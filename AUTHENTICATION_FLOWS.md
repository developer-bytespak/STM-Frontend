## 🎯 What Changed (Fix Applied)

### Before (WRONG):
```
Signup → OTP → Success → Dashboard → Redirects to Login ❌
```

### After (CORRECT):
```
Signup → OTP → Success + Auto-Login → Dashboard ✅
```

### The Fix:
Added auth session creation after successful OTP verification in signup:
```typescript
// After OTP verification in signup
localStorage.setItem('auth_token', token);
localStorage.setItem('user_email', email);
localStorage.setItem('user_role', 'customer');
```

Now user is automatically logged in after signup! ✅

**Logout:** Click logout button in dashboard → Clears all session data

- ✅ **Login** = Email + Password (traditional login, no OTP)
- ✅ **OTP only used for signup verification** (email verification)
- ✅ **No need to login after signup** (automatic session)
- ✅ **Password required for login** (standard authentication)
