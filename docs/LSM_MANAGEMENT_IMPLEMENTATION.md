---

## 🔌 Backend Integration

### **Already Working:**
```typescript
✅ POST /admin/lsm/create
   Request: { email, password, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, region }
   Response: { id, user, region, status, message }
```

### **Needed for Full Functionality:**
```typescript
⏳ GET /admin/lsms
   Response: { lsms: [...] }
```

**Complete implementation code is in:** `BACKEND_APIS_NEEDED.md` (lines 643-753)

---

## 🎯 What Happens Now

### **LSM Creation:**
1. **Frontend sends:**
   ```json
   {
     "email": "newlsm@example.com",
     "password": "securepass123",
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Manager",
     "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
     "region": "San Francisco"
   }
   ```

2. **Backend creates:**
   - New user with role `local_service_manager`
   - New LSM record linked to user
   - Returns success response

3. **Frontend:**
   - Shows success message
   - Closes modal
   - Refreshes pending actions count
   - Refreshes LSM list (when endpoint ready)

### **LSM Viewing:**
1. **Currently:** Shows 4 mock LSMs with stats
2. **When backend ready:** Automatically fetches real LSMs from `GET /admin/lsms`
3. **Features:**
   - Filter by region
   - See all stats
   - View contact info

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test LSM Creation:**
```bash
# 1. Start your servers
npm run dev  # Frontend
npm run start:dev  # Backend

# 2. Login as admin
# 3. Navigate to /admin/dashboard
# 4. Click "Create LSM" in Quick Actions
# 5. Fill form:
   First Name: Test
   Last Name: Manager
   Email: test.lsm@example.com
   Password: password123
   Phone: +1234567890
   Region: Test Region

# 6. Submit → Should create successfully!
```

### **Verify in Database:**
```sql
-- Check user created
SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 'local_service_manager' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check LSM created
SELECT * FROM local_service_managers ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **To Complete LSM Management:**

1. **Implement Backend Endpoint:**
   ```typescript
   // admin.controller.ts
   @Get('lsms')
   async getAllLSMs() {
     return this.adminService.getAllLSMs();
   }
   ```
   
   **Full code in:** `BACKEND_APIS_NEEDED.md` lines 673-745

2. **Test Real Data:**
   - Create a few LSMs using the modal
   - Implement `GET /admin/lsms`
   - Refresh dashboard → See real LSMs!

3. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Edit LSM functionality
   - Deactivate LSM
   - View LSM details page
   - Assign providers to LSM
