## Tips for Maximum Savings

### 1. Book Longer When Possible
If you're unsure how long you'll need space, consider booking for a full month rather than multiple weekly bookings:
- 4 weeks daily = Often 30-40% more expensive than 1 month

### 2. Compare Options
Always review all pricing options shown - sometimes the recommended option isn't what you expected!

### 3. Plan Ahead
Booking in advance gives you:
- Better availability
- More time to compare options
- Ability to choose preferred dates/times

### 4. Consider Partial Months
For 15-20 day needs:
- Compare: 3 weeks weekly vs. 20 days daily
- The system shows you the best value automatically

### 5. Use Amenities Wisely
If you need specific amenities:
- Filter by office type
- Check amenity icons on cards
- Mention in special requests if critical
