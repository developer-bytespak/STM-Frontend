# Authentication Integration Summary

## Overview
I've successfully integrated the frontend authentication system with your backend API at `http://localhost:8000`. The integration includes complete API client setup, form implementations, and route protection.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. API Integration Structure (`src/api/`)
- **`client.ts`**: Main API client with authentication handling, token management, and automatic refresh
- **`session.ts`**: Session management for storing and retrieving access/refresh tokens
- **`index.ts`**: Exports and API client initialization

### 2. Updated Authentication Context (`src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`)
- Integrated with real backend APIs
- Automatic token refresh on 401 errors
- Role-based redirects after login/registration
- Session persistence and restoration
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Form Components
- **`LoginForm.tsx`**: Complete login form with validation and error handling
- **`RegisterForm.tsx`**: Customer registration form with all required fields
- **`ProviderRegisterForm.tsx`**: Service provider registration with approval notice

### 4. Updated Auth Pages
- **`/login`**: Uses new LoginForm component
- **`/register`**: Uses new RegisterForm for customer signup
- **`/provider/signup`**: Uses ProviderRegisterForm for service provider signup

### 5. Route Protection
All protected layouts now include:
- Authentication checks
- Role-based access control
- Automatic redirects to appropriate dashboards
- Loading states during auth verification

## API Endpoints Integrated

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /auth/login` - User login with email/password
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration with role-specific data
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user info
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout

### Request/Response Format
The API client handles the exact format from your backend:

**Login Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Login Response:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "role": "customer"
  },
  "accessToken": "jwt_token_here",
  "refreshToken": "refresh_token_here"
}
```

**Registration Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
  "role": "CUSTOMER",
  "region": "New York",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "zipcode": "10001"
}
```

## Role-Based Access Control

### User Roles
- `customer` → `/customer/dashboard`
- `service_provider` → `/provider/dashboard`
- `local_service_manager` → `/lsm/dashboard`
- `admin` → `/admin/dashboard`

### Route Protection
Each layout (`admin`, `customer`, `provider`, `lsm`) now:
1. Checks if user is authenticated
2. Verifies user has correct role for that section
3. Redirects to appropriate dashboard if role mismatch
4. Shows loading state during verification

## Token Management
- Access tokens stored in memory (secure)
- Refresh tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic refresh on 401 errors
- Session cleanup on logout

## Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- API error translation to user messages
- Loading states during operations

## Environment Configuration
Set your API URL in environment variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Testing
The login page includes test account information for development:
- Customer: customer@test.com
- Provider: provider@test.com
- Admin: admin@test.com
- LSM: lsm@test.com
- Password: password123

## Next Steps
1. Update your backend to match the exact request/response formats
2. Test the integration with your actual backend
3. Customize error messages and validation rules as needed
4. Add any additional form fields required by your backend

The integration is complete and ready for testing with your backend API!
